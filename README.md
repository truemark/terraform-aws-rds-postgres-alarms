# terraform-aws-rds-postgres-alarms
This repo defines AWS RDS postgres specific alarm definitions (not Aurora). These alarms monitor postgres replication between master and replica.

Each alarm listed below is created by default. Creation can be disabled by setting the associated alarm create parameter to false. For example, to not create the alarm replica_db_load_anomaly, set the parameter create_replica_db_load_anomaly_alarm to false.

Threshold alarms are included. Anomaly alarm creation can be disabled by setting the variable create_anomaly_alarms to false.
